abstract: "The physical properties of a biomaterial play an essential role in regulating immune and reparative
activities within the host tissue. This study aimed to evaluate the immunological impact of
material stiffness of a glycol-chitosan hydrogel designed for vocal fold tissue engineering.
Hydrogel stiffness was varied via the concentration of glyoxal cross-linker applied. Hydrogel
mechanical properties were characterized through atomic force microscopy and shear plate
rheometry. Using a transwell setup, macrophages were co-cultured with human vocal fold
fibroblasts that were embedded within the hydrogel. Macrophage viability and cytokine secretion
were evaluated at 3, 24, and 72 hr of culture. Flow cytometry was applied to evaluate macrophage
cell surface markers after 72 hr of cell culture. Results indicated that increasing hydrogel stiffness
was associated with increased anti-inflammatory activity compared to relevant controls. In
addition, increased anti-inflammatory activity was observed in hydrogel co-cultures. This study
highlighted the importance of hydrogel stiffness from an immunological viewpoint when
designing novel vocal fold hydrogels."
