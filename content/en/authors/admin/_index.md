I am passionate about human cognition & language, data science & AI and software development. I am currently looking for new professional opportunities in R&D related to these fields.

As part of my PhD in the McGill Neurocognition of Language lab, I investigated how the brain processes language. More specifically, I evaluated how semantic relations and sentence structure influence the way the brain accesses the meaning of words in real time. 

Besides my research, I  develop software, whether in the form of an R package for neuroimaging research (ERPscope) or in the form of mobile iOS apps to assess oral language development 

These apps allow to evaluate the development of oral language in children and detect language difficulties early on (Phophlo) or to assess and treat the perception of speech sounds in a speech & language therapy context (SAILS).
