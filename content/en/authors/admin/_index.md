I am passionate about data science and software development, whether to create useful tools for scientists and clinicians, study human cognition & language, or in the context of artificial intelligence.

As part of my Ph.D. in the McGill Neurocognition of Language lab, I evaluated how semantic relations and sentence structure influence the way the brain accesses the words’ meaning in real-time. To that end, I used advanced statistical modelling on event-related potentials data (a neuroimaging technique based on EEG). As I lacked a tool to best visualize and explore high-dimensional ERP data, I created a new R package (ERPscope) to easily perform high-quality and customizable analyses and visualizations.

Besides my research, I develop software in the form of mobile iOS apps. Phophlo allows to evaluate oral language production and perception in children and detect language difficulties early on, while SAILS helps to assess and treat the perception of speech sounds in a speech & language therapy context.
