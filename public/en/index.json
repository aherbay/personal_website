However, the real-time processing of syntax and its relation to semantics remain disputed, especially regarding the effect of the hypothesized hierarchical relations among words over linear relations. Research on semantic processing has made extensive use of priming paradigms to study online access and retrieval of meaning. Extension of these paradigms to sentence contexts, however, has yielded mixed results, especially regarding the influence of syntactic relations. In the present self-paced reading study, we used grammatical, meaningful sentences to investigate how the syntactic relations and linear distance between prime and target words influence semantic priming effects, as reflected in target word reading times of 64 native speakers of English. Each participant read 160 experimental sentences, each followed by a Yes-No comprehension question. Experimental sentences contained a prime and a target word with two levels of semantic association (high vs. low association, e.g., ‘mistress’ - ‘affair’ vs. ‘actress’ - ‘affair’). Crucially, we varied the structure between the prime and the target, both in terms of (1) the number of intervening words (linear distance, 2 vs. at least 4 words) and (2) number and type of intervening syntactic nodes (syntactic relation). Linear mixed effects models revealed semantic priming when the prime and target were in a direct syntactic relation, and interference effects when they were in an indirect relation, both at short and long linear distances. The strength of these effects was correlated with semantic priming effects found in a word pair relatedness judgement task, as well as with digit span results measuring working memory capacity. These results suggest that structural relationships modulate within-sentence semantic priming while linear distance only plays a marginal role. We interpret these results in the context of cue-based retrieval parsing theories. Related primes facilitate semantic integration when in a direct syntactic relationship with the target but may be incorrectly integrated with the target noun and lead to interference effects when in an indirect relation. Syntactic processes participate in the creation of a hierarchically structured representation of the sentence that implements specific relations between words and that guides the real-time semantic processing of each incoming word.","tags":[""],"title":"Syntactic hierarchical structures modulate within-sentence semantic priming beyond linear distance in self-paced reading (to be submitted)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexandre Herbay","Phaedra Royle","Karsten Steinhauer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1698710400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1698710400,"objectID":"2fc8f4b61e21cd1e4364a1903f43d4e3","permalink":"https://www.alexandreherbay.com/en/publication/pop2/","publishdate":"2022-10-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/pop2/","section":"publication","summary":"Whereas mechanisms underlying lexical access and semantic priming have been widely investigated, neurocognitive processing of specific semantic relations remains controversial. Previous studies on relational semantic priming have found that related word pairs (e.g., long- short) show stronger priming effects if they are preceded by other prime-target pairs that share the same type of semantic relationship (consistent pairs) compared to pairs of a different semantic relation (inconsistent pairs). In event-related potentials (ERPs), this consistency effect was associated with a reduced negative amplitude in the late N400 time window, and its long latency of 400-700 ms after target word onset was taken to reflect post-lexical integration processes in working memory (Steinhauer et al., 2017). However, given the short 250 ms SOA in that study, it was not possible to rule out delayed prediction-based effects. Moreover, syntactic word category changes for inconsistent pairs (e.g., adjectives within a list of noun pairs) were not controlled for. In the present ERP study, we increased the SOA to 450 ms and recorded EEG while 40 native speakers of French read and evaluated 720 word-pairs nested into 9 experimental lists, each promoting a specific semantic relation and a specific syntactic word category. We found ERP consistency effects starting early on the prime word, as well as N250 and N400 effects reflecting effects on both the form and meaning processing of the target word. Thus, word pairs with a list-inconsistent semantic relation displayed smaller priming effects than consistent word pairs, and priming was even more reduced when pairs also had a different syntactic category. Finally, participants with faster response times for related pairs displayed stronger effects on the prime word, reflecting proactive and strategic processing. In contrast, slower participants displayed smaller or no effects on the prime, but instead late positivities after target onset that could be associated with reactive processing. These results suggest that predictive mechanisms are likely to underlie optimal relational semantic priming. However, prediction of the target word is not systematic, and relational priming can also happen at a slower pace, based on an evaluation of the semantic relation that follows lexical access.","tags":[""],"title":"The neurocognitive mechanisms underlying proactive and retrospective semantic relational priming as revealed by event-related potentials elicited by prime and target words (to be submitted)","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1655683200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1655683200,"objectID":"7385979c26a08ea291505ce3f6c9ea68","permalink":"https://www.alexandreherbay.com/en/tutorials-content/r_introduction/","publishdate":"2022-06-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/tutorials-content/r_introduction/","section":"tutorials-content","summary":"An introduction for total beginner explaining the basics of programming, R and RStudio","tags":["Tutorial","R","RStudio"],"title":"Introduction to R an RStudio","type":"tutorials-content"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1653004800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653004800,"objectID":"069410be62ab0ffd8d36d21e065d9041","permalink":"https://www.alexandreherbay.com/en/tutorials-content/create-r-project/","publishdate":"2022-05-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/tutorials-content/create-r-project/","section":"tutorials-content","summary":"Discover the different steps to create an R project in RStudio","tags":["Tutorial","R"],"title":"Create a project in R Studio","type":"tutorials-content"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1652486400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1652486400,"objectID":"75e9b097ef502f44d6de52dbecb1cfc4","permalink":"https://www.alexandreherbay.com/en/presentations-content/2022_thesis_defence/","publishdate":"2022-05-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/presentations-content/2022_thesis_defence/","section":"presentations-content","summary":"Thesis defence presentation","tags":["Other"],"title":"The modulation of semantic association effects by relational and syntactic structures -

ERP or Event-Related Potentials are a neuroimaging technique based on EEG, or electro-encephalography. Electrodes are placed on the scalp to record the electrical activity of the brain in real time. ERP research focuses on the brain’s electrical activity in the milliseconds that follows specific events (e.g., presentation of a specific word, picture or sound). Metaphorically, we could compare it to setting up 64 microphones over an arena during a hockey game. The idea is then to infer how does hockey work using the sound recording. For example we notice a big clamour coming from one side of the arena when one of the two teams scores).\nLooking at ERP data The resulting data for each participants is usually data for hundreds of items for several dozens of electrodes. This data are preprocessed from the continuous recording of the brain’s electrical activity (filtering, correction, removal of noise data…) using different existing toolboxes (e.g., Fieldtrip, EEGLab, ERPLab, MNE Python). However, in these toolboxes, it can be a challenge to create customized plots to display these data. Moreover, data are often exported to the R environment to perform advanced statistical modeling. ERPscope was developped with the idea of completing this gap without replacing any other tool.\nGoals of ERPscope: plot and explore The first goal of ERPscope is to visualize the data through three classic plots:\nERP plots Difference wave plots Voltage maps or topoplots The second goal is to facilitate data exploration and more specifically:\nAssess the variability of ERP effects accross participants through correlation plots between ERP effects and external variable Run the same model across different time-windows More details will come soon. The abstract of the preprint of the paper ERPscope can be found below.

Oral language skills are closely related to literacy development in children. When a child has weak oral language skills, they will have difficulty achieving reading and writing competencies within the expected time frame. In this paper, we present results from a longitudinal and cross-sectional study of the relationship between oral language skills in pre-literate children, and one aspect of their literacy skills in early elementary school—specifically, spelling. The study was conducted with French-speaking children and French-language learners from Quebec, a population that has been understudied in this area. We developed a predictive tool that will allow teachers and other professionals to assess oral language skills in young children and to predict those children at risk for literacy difficulties. Specifically, we screened children’s speech perception, speech production, phonological awareness, and morphology production abilities at entry to first grade and predicted spelling skills at the end of second grade. The screening tool that we developed proved to have a sensitivity of 71% and a specificity of 93% as a screen for poor spelling abilities.","tags":["Canadian Journal of Speech-Language Pathology"],"title":"Development of a Tool to Screen Risk of Literacy Delays in French-Speaking Children: PHOPHLO.","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1497916800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1497916800,"objectID":"85ba155ddb1989ad491420e22401d093","permalink":"https://www.alexandreherbay.com/en/presentations-content/2017_06_bimo/","publishdate":"2017-06-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/presentations-content/2017_06_bimo/","section":"presentations-content","summary":"Présentation lors de la conférence internationale Bilingualism vs. Monolingualism - A new perspective on limitations to L2 acquisition","tags":["Conference"],"title":"Can French-English bilinguals process verb-particle constructions in a native-like manner?","type":"presentations-content"},{"authors":["Fayden Bokhari","Alexandre Herbay","Karsten Steinhaeur"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1494374400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1494374400,"objectID":"103abfed0f3561f58c300475c95313d0","permalink":"https://www.alexandreherbay.com/en/publication/2017_2/","publishdate":"2017-05-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/2017_2/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Les mécanismes neurocognitifs sous-jacents aux aspects de sémantique logique du traitement de la phrase : une étude en Potentiel Évoqués (PÉs) sur la vérification des conditions de vérités.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fayden Bokhari","Alexandre Herbay","Karsten Steinhaeur"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1491004800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1491004800,"objectID":"a839c8eb94b9a0eb8b5df9dad8a7d4f0","permalink":"https://www.alexandreherbay.com/en/publication/2017_1/","publishdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/2017_1/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Neurocognitive mechanisms underlying truth-conditional and logical semantic aspects of sentence processing as revealed by event-related potentials (ERPs).","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"a\n","date":1481846400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1481846400,"objectID":"22576120a384f5877a013575abcfeb48","permalink":"https://www.alexandreherbay.com/en/presentations-content/2016_12_comps/","publishdate":"2016-12-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/presentations-content/2016_12_comps/","section":"presentations-content","summary":"Presenting my comprehensive exam major paper","tags":["Other"],"title":"Routes to Visual Word Recognition Modelling - A comparative analysis of 3 computational models of reading aloud","type":"presentations-content"},{"authors":["Alexandre Herbay","Phaedra Royle","Laura M.
