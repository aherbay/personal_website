      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a PhD candidate in the Neurocognition of Language Lab (lead by Dr. Karsten Steinhauer) and in the Neurolinguistics Lab (lead by Dr. Shari Baum), at the McGill School of Communication Sciences and Disorders. I am interested in how the brain processes language, more specifically how it accesses meaning and structures sentences in less than a second. I am also developping mobile apps for research projects that aims assess language development and detect language difficulties as early as possible. &lt;br&gt;
More details will be uploaded on the website in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
